# ü§ñ BotForge

![BotForge icon](res/icon_flat.png)

**BotForge** is a modular .NET chatbot building framework powered by a finite state machine (FSM) architecture.
It started as an internal tool for a university hackathon and evolved into an open-source project for developers who want structured, modular, and declarative bot logic.

---

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Provide a **clean FSM architecture** for complex conversational flows
- Offer a **modular system** with declarative state definitions and role-based access
- Deliver **Telegram integration** with room for other platforms in the future
- Simplify bot development through **hosting support**, **dependency injection**, and **extensibility**

## üì¶ Solution Structure

| Package | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BotForge.Core` | Core FSM engine and dispatching logic |
| `BotForge.Telegram` | Telegram API integration layer |
| `BotForge.Persistence` | EF Core-based FSM state storage |
| `BotForge.Modules` | Modular system and declarative FSM attributes |
| `BotForge.Hosting` | Integration with `IHostBuilder` and DI container |
| `BotForge.Analyzers` | Roslyn analyzers for FSM attribute validation |

## üß∞ Current Status

> üõ†Ô∏è The project is in an **early development stage**.
> A public release will follow after the stabilization of the FSM core and Telegram adapter.
